## 🎮 What Fresh Madness Is This?

A CLI game where you:
- Guess football legends from **AI-crafted clues** 🤖
- Battle through 5 attempts before public shaming 🚨
- Discover new ways to spell "Mbappé" wrong 😅
- Question if the AI actually knows football 🤔

## 🚀 Features
- **AI-Powered Clues**: Witty hints from Ollama/DeepSeek (no boring stats!) 🤖
- **50 Legends**: From Messi to hidden gems 🌟
- **Terminal Glam**: Bubble Tea UI with emoji explosions 🍵✨
- **Smart Guessing**: Partial name matching ("CR7" = ❌, "Ronaldo" = ✅)

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/devbaheti/PitchMind.git

# Install dependencies
go mod download

# Start the game (requires Ollama)
go run main.go
 
```

## System Requirements:

- A computer (surprisingly) 💻
- Go 1.20+ (younger versions get red cards) 🟥
- Ollama running DeepSeek/Llama3.2 (AI brain gym) 🏋️♂️


## ❓ FAQ (Frequently Avoided Questions)

- **Q: Why do partial names work but not nicknames?**  
  **A:** Our AI is a stickler for accuracy. Try "Kylian Mbappé" instead of "Speedy McFastFace" 🏃💨  

- **Q: The AI called me a Sunday League player!**  
  **A:** Either enable `--thick-skin` mode or shed a tear onto your keyboard 🧻⌨️  

- **Q: Can I add myself as a player?**  
  **A:** Of course! Just be ready for clues like "Moves like a startled gazelle" 🦌  

- **Q: Why only 50 players?**  
  **A:** More than FIFA’s ethics committee, less than Ronaldo’s ego 😉
